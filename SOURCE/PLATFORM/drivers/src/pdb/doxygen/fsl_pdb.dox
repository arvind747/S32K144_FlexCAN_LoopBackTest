@defgroup pdb Programmable Delay Block (PDB)
@details 
The S32 SDK provides both HAL and Peripheral Drivers for the Programmable Delay Block (PDB) module of S32 SDK devices.

The PDB is a configurable counter that can generate events (triggers) that can be used by the ADC to start conversions
or routed through TRGMUX to other modules in the S32K144.
