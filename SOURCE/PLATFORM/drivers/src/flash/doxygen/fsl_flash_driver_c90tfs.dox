@defgroup flash Flash Memory (Flash)
@details
Flash memory is ideal for single-supply applications, permitting in-the-field erase and
reprogramming operations without the need for any external high voltage power sources.
The flash module includes a memory controller that executes commands to modify flash
memory contents. An erased bit reads '1' and a programmed bit reads '0'. The
programming operation is unidirectional; it can only move bits from the '1' state (erased)
to the '0' state (programmed). Only the erase operation restores bits from '0' to '1'; bits
cannot be programmed from a '0' to a '1'.

@ingroup flash
@details
The C90TFS flash module includes the following accessible memory regions.
1. Program flash memory for vector space and code store.
2. FlexNVM for data store, additional code store and also nonvolatile storage for the EEPROM
filing system representing data written to the FlexRAM requiring highest endurance.
3. FlexRAM for high-endurance EEPROM data store or traditional RAM.

Some platforms may be designed to have only program flash memory or all of them.

The S32 SDK provides the C90TFS Flash driver of S32K platforms.
The driver includes general APIs to handle specific operations on C90TFS Flash module.
The user can use those APIs directly in the application.

# EEPROM feature

For platforms with FlexNVM, the flash module provides a built-in hardware emulation scheme to emulate
the characteristics of an EEPROM by effectively providing a high-endurance, byte-writable NVM.
The EEPROM system is shown in the following figure.

 <center><i>Figure 1. EEPROM Architecture</i></center>
To handle with various customer's requirements, the FlexRAM and FlexNVM blocks can be split into partitions:
1. EEPROM partition(EEESIZE) — The amount of FlexRAM used for EEPROM can be set from 0 Bytes (no EEPROM)
to the maximum FlexRAM size. The remainder of the FlexRAM not used for EEPROM is not accessible while
the FlexRAM is configured for EEPROM.The EEPROM partition grows upward from the bottom of the FlexRAM
address space.
2. Data flash partition(DEPART) — The amount of FlexNVM memory used for data flash can be programmed
from 0 bytes (all of the FlexNVM block is available for EEPROM backup) to the maximum size of the FlexNVM block.
3. FlexNVM EEPROM partition — The amount of FlexNVM memory used for EEPROM backup, which is equal to the
FlexNVM block size minus the data flash memory partition size. The EEPROM backup size must be at least
16 times the EEPROM partition size in FlexRAM.

The partition information (EEESIZE, DEPART) is programmed using the <b>DEFlashPartition</b> API.

The function of FlexRAM can be changed from EEPROM usage to  traditional RAM for
accelerate programming in ProgramSection API and vice versa by <b>SetEEEEnable</b> API.

This is example code of EEE usage sequence:

    /* Provide information about the flash blocks. */

    {
        0x00000000u,                                /* Base address of Program Flash block */

         * - DEPartitionCode = 0x04u: EEPROM backup size = 64 Kbytes */
        ret = DEFlashPartition(&flashSSDConfig, 0x38u, 0x4u, pCmdSequence);
        if (ret != FTFx_OK)

            {

# Important Note

1. To use callback in the application, this callback function must not
be placed in the same Flash block in which a program/erase operation is going on
to avoid the RWW error.
2. To suspend the sector erase operation for a simple method, invoke the
<b>FlashEraseSuspend</b> function within callback of <b>FlashEraseSector</b>. In this case, the
<b>FlashEraseSuspend</b> must not be placed in the same block in which the Flash erase sector
command is going on.
3. <b>FlashCommandSequence</b>, <b>FlashSuspend</b> and <b>FlashResume</b> should be executed from RAM
or different Flash blocks which are targeted for writing to avoid the RWW error.
<b>FlashSuspend</b> and <b>FlashResume</b> functions should be called in pairs.
4. To guarantee the correct execution of this driver, the Flash cache in the Flash memory
controller module should be disabled before invoking any API.
5. Partitioning FlexNVM and FlexRAM for EEPROM usage shall be executed only once in the lifetime of the device.
6. After successfully partitioning FlexNVM and FlexRAM for EEPROM usage, user needs to call <b>FlashInit</b>
to update memory information in global structure.
