@details The FlexIO is a highly configurable module providing a wide range of functionality
including:
 - Emulation of a variety of serial communication protocols, such as SPI, I2C, I2S or UART, 
 while requiring low CPU overhead and being more efficient that having multiple dedicated 
 peripherals for each protocol.
 - Flexible 16-bit timers with support for a variety of trigger, reset, enable and disable
conditions
