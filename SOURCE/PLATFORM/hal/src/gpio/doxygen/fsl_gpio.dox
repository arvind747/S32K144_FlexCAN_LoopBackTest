@details 
The S32 SDK provides both HAL and Peripheral Drivers for the General Purpose Input-Output (GPIO) module of S32 SDK devices.

The GPIO allows setting a pin either as an input or output and has dedicated registers for the following operations:
    - configuring the pin direction (input-output)
    - reading inputs and writing outputs
    - setting/clearing/toggling pins without a read-modify-write operation
